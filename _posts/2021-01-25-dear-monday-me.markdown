Happy Monday, folks.  Hope you all had a restful weekend.  

If you’re anything like me, crossing the Friday to Monday “mental gap” has always been a bit of a struggle.  Finding my cadence on Monday mornings can be tenuous even on my best days.  

About a year ago, I started a practice that I call “Dear Monday Me.”  Simple concept: a note to my brain-dead Monday morning self, looking to put momentum back in my mental flywheel, written by my much more focused and level-headed Friday afternoon self before punching out for the weekend.  Nothing more than a brief memory dump that sets my direction for Monday morning (before Monday morning arrives) and helps mitigate some weekend anxiety especially on Sunday evening.     

Every Friday around noon, I borrow 15-20 minutes from my calendar to jot down a few things:

1)  All items that I worked or otherwise touched that day along with a brief description of their status/next step.  This is actually a really impactful daily ritual, but super important proceeding a holiday.  

2)  Specific call outs for important due dates and milestones occurring the following week especially if they fall on Monday/Tuesday.  Condense your calendar into the big items you know must get completed.

3)  At least one strategic intention targeted at modifying a particular pattern/behavior/thought process (e.g. “increase focus time by modulating my inclination to multi-task”).

This note is the FIRST thing I read before I even get out of bed on Monday.  I'll typically schedule this as an outbound e-mail so it's at the top of my mailbox.  It’s not rocket science, but it helps.  Use it, modify it, share your own process.  

Do big things this week.  #powerUp
