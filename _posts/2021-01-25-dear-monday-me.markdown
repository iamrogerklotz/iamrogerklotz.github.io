Happy Monday, folks.  Hope you all had a restful weekend.  

If you’re anything like me, crossing the Friday to Monday “mental gap” has always been a bit of a struggle.  Finding my cadence on Monday mornings can be tenuous even on my best days.  

About a year ago, I started a practice that I call “Dear Monday Me.”  Simple concept: a note to my brain-dead Monday morning self, looking to put momentum back in my mental flywheel, written by my Friday afternoon self before punching out for the weekend.  Nothing more than a quick memory dump to set me up for success on Monday morning AND reduce weekend anxiety (especially on Sunday night).   

Every Friday around noon, I borrow 15-20 minutes from my calendar to jot down a few things:

1)  All items that I worked that day along with a brief description of their status/next step.  This is actually a really impactful daily ritual, but super important proceeding a weekend.

2)  Specific call outs for important due dates and milestones occurring the following week especially if they fall on Monday/Tuesday.  Condense your calendar into the big items you know must get completed.
  
3)  At least one strategic intention targeted at modifying a particular pattern/behavior/thought process (e.g. “increase focus time by modulating my disposition for multi-tasking”).

This note is the FIRST thing I read before I even get out of bed on Monday.  It’s not rocket science, but it helps.  Use it, modify it, share your own process.  

Do big things this week.  #powerUp
