Like many of you, I find myself to be a context-driven learner.  My most effective discovery is always coupled with real (hopefully interesting) use-cases I can explore organically rather than traditional course work, self-study via reading, etc.  Despite spending most of my time in the field helping end-users with their own challenges, it can be difficult at times to find problem statements that provide opportunities to explore particular technologies in which Iâ€™m interested.  In the few months to come, I knew I wanted to get a bit deeper with a few technologies: 

1) Containerization via Azure Kubernetes (AKS) and Docker  
2) Github and Azure Devops integration  
3) Basic Python and C# scripting   

I spent a few weeks noodling on what I could work with that was both relevant to these services and generally durable (from both a fun and utility perspective) that might provide some opportunity to "get smart".  Following my recent home network upgrade project including RaspberryPis for PiHole/Unbound DNS sinkholing, I figured I would continue the Pi theme.  

I stumbled on a TON of basic Python-based robotics projects on Amazon that seemed to tick the "fun" box, and decided building a Docker Swarm on a cluster of RaspberryPis might be an effective way to create some resiliency for my local DNS resolvers and provide some local capacity to run a few other containers.  As such, I snatched up this neat Yahboom tank project, a load of RaspberryPi 4s, random components and a fresh cup (or ten) of coffee...let's see where this goes.
